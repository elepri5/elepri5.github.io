<a href = "https://form.jotform.com/230673382561356"> # Consultation form </a>

# Initial consultation

This session covers the basic nature of the individual. It highlights strengths that can be relied upon, and weaknesses that can impede one from living to the highest potential. The reading also covers the analysis of karmic lessons of the individual, and soulâ€™s life purpose.
This reading focuses on the areas of particular interest to the client (relationships, family, children, finances, career, spirituality, location, or any other questions or interests). Various methods of working with problematic areas will also be recommended.

# Follow-up consultation

This session is for additional questions beyond the birth chart reading. We can go deeper into any area of your choice. 

# Child consultation

This session is for parents or carers. It covers the analysis of the inner nature of the child; potential strengths that can be enhanced, potential weaknesses that need some attention; the ways the child is best approached in raising and educating; general life direction and purpose. The relationship between the child and the parent/carer (the one taking consultation) can optionally be discussed (birth data of the parent/carer provided).
