<a href = "https://form.jotform.com/230673382561356"> <big><b>Consultation form</b></big> </a>

Online consultations are held via either Zoom or Skype and recorded unless otherwise requested.

# Initial consultation

This session covers the basic nature of the individual. It highlights strengths that can be relied upon, and weaknesses that can impede one from living to the highest potential. The reading also covers the analysis of karmic lessons of the individual, and soulâ€™s life purpose.
This reading focuses on the areas of particular interest to the client (relationships, family, children, finances, career, spirituality, location, or any other questions or interests). Various methods of working with problematic areas will also be recommended.

# Follow-up consultation

This session is for additional questions beyond the birth chart reading. We can go deeper into any area of your choice. 

# Child consultation

This session is for parents or carers. It covers the analysis of the inner nature of the child; potential strengths that can be enhanced, potential weaknesses that need some attention; the ways the child is best approached in raising and educating; general life direction and purpose. The relationship between the child and the parent/carer (the one taking consultation) can optionally be discussed (birth data of the parent/carer provided).

# Compatibility consultation
This reading is especially helpful at the very start of a new relationship in order to get an idea about what can support the relationship, as well as aspects that might be challenging. In case of issues in an existing relationship we discuss the source of upcoming difficulties and ways for solving them from the client's perspective. This reading is done with one person coming with both charts, so that you could speak freely without having the other person present.
