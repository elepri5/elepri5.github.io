My name is **Yelena**. I’m a trained astrologer in the parampara (tradition) of  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achyutananda_Dasa">Sri Achyutananda Das</a> . This tradition comes from Odisha region in India, and is over 500 years old. The current Parampara Guru is <a href="https://srath.com">Pandit Sanjay Rath</a> .

In the background I have a PhD in Math, and over 10 years experience as a university professor. In my astrological practice I benefit a lot from my teaching and research experience. My approach to chart reading is based on combining ancient wisdom with logic and modern scientific achievements.

I’m also interested in psychology, especially in <a href="https://neufeldinstitute.org">Gordon Neufeld’s</a>  attachment-based developmental approach and in <a href="https://iceeft.com/what-is-eft/"> emotionally focused therapy</a>.
